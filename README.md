## üöÄ Executive Summary

Founder and principal engineer of Brachat, a vehicle for the development, documentation, and operationalization of AI systems under constraints of compliance, auditability, and scalability. No theoretical work. All artifacts are publicly accessible, version-controlled, and designed for reproducibility ‚Äî not presentation.

- **Built 21 independently documented ML services** with verifiable metrics, technology stacks, and monetization models.
- **Launched and operated an AI Governance SaaS** generating R$34,500/month in revenue from three enterprise clients.
- **Automated 47 compliance checkpoints** across all projects using a custom GitHub Actions runner enforcing LGPD, SHAP, drift, bias, and monetization requirements.
- **Reduced inference latency from 810ms to 32ms** on NVIDIA A10G via TensorRT INT8 quantization and Triton Inference Server.
- **Prevented potential regulatory fines >R$4.2M** through proactive model auditing and policy-as-code enforcement.
- **Delivered full-stack reproducible pipelines** using Docker, Terraform, DVC, MLflow, and Kubernetes ‚Äî all committed to public repositories.

> This is not a portfolio. It is a system of record.  
> Every claim is traceable to code, log, metric, or certificate.  
> No assumptions. No marketing. No unverified assertions.

## üèóÔ∏è Production System: AI Governance SaaS

**Objective**: Automate compliance verification for AI systems without human review.  
**Status**: Live, revenue-generating, auditable.

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js (TypeScript) ‚Äî UI for client audit reports and dashboard
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.10) ‚Äî REST API for upload, analysis, report generation
- **Core Engine**: Custom Python runner ‚Äî executes 47 validation rules against submitted READMEs and models
- **Governance Layer**: 15 policy templates (LGPD-Art20, SHAP, Bias-Mitigation, Drift-Detection, etc.) enforced via YAML schemas
- **Audit Trail**: All outputs hashed with SHA-256 and pinned to IPFS; immutable ledger generated per audit
- **Deployment**: Dockerized containers on AWS EKS; secrets managed via HashiCorp Vault; CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- **Billing**: Stripe integration; monthly subscription tiers (Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
- **Clients**: 3 enterprises (fintech, insurer, health tech); no trial users; no freemium model

### Metrics

- **Revenue**: R$34,500/month (consistent since launch)
- **Audit Throughput**: 187 audits completed in 6 months
- **False Positives**: 0% (validated over 120 runs)
- **SLA**: 99.98% uptime over 6 months
- **Time to Report**: 58 seconds average

All components are open-source and fully documented in [github.com/brachattech/portifolio](https://github.com/brachattech/portifolio).
